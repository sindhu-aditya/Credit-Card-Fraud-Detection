# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant problem for financial institutions and their customers. With the increasing number of credit card transactions happening every day, the risk of fraudulent transactions is also on the rise. The main challenge for financial institutions is to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time while minimizing false positives. This project aims to build a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning algorithms to automatically detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions while minimizing false positives. The model will be trained on historical transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies that can indicate fraudulent behavior.

## Methodology
The project will follow the following methodology:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Collect credit card transaction data, including both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
   - Use publicly available datasets, such as those from Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Preprocess the collected data to remove any missing or irrelevant information.
   - Perform feature engineering to create new features that can improve the performance of the machine learning model.

3. **Model Selection**: 
   - Evaluate various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
   - Select the best-performing model for credit card fraud detection.

4. **Model Training**: 
   - Train the selected model on the preprocessed data.
   - Use techniques such as cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

5. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
   - Compare the model with other state-of-the-art models to determine its effectiveness.

## Expected Outcomes
The expected outcome of this project is a highly accurate machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. The model will be able to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy while minimizing false positives. This will help financial institutions prevent financial losses due to fraudulent activities and protect their customers from potential fraud.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes transactions that occurred over a period of two days, with a total of 284,807 transactions. Among these, 492 transactions are identified as fraudulent, making the dataset highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions.

### Features

- **Numerical Input Variables**: All input features are numerical and have been transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to protect confidentiality. As a result, the original features and additional background information are not available. The features are labeled as V1, V2, ..., V28, representing the principal components obtained through PCA.

- **Time**: This feature represents the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. It has not been transformed using PCA.

- **Amount**: This feature indicates the transaction amount. It can be used for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning and has not been transformed using PCA.

- **Class**: This is the response variable, where a value of 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a non-fraudulent transaction.

### Key Characteristics

- **Imbalance**: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions making up a very small fraction of the total transactions. This presents a challenge for model training and evaluation, as the model must be sensitive enough to detect the minority class (frauds) while maintaining a low false positive rate.

- **Confidentiality**: Due to confidentiality constraints, the dataset does not include original feature names or additional background information. The PCA transformation ensures that sensitive information is not disclosed.

This dataset is publicly available and can be accessed from sources such as Kaggle. It provides a realistic scenario for developing and testing machine learning models for credit card fraud detection.
